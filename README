This was my 1st website in college. Originally built in notepad++ as a ststic website. After learning the Java Play Framework i decided to change the website in a Java Play Dynamic Website. This was a good experience and i learned a lot from it. To run the application download or clone the repository. Cd into the project folder and in terminal enter activator run. after all file are loaded you should be able to view the website on localhost:8000. 
This website consistsed of multiple pages spanning the entire Middle earth of books and films created by J.R.R.Tolien and also the Films created by Peter Jackson. In each page i tried to implement differnt pieces of code so that each page was different. As this was myfirst website i was really happy with the outcome of it, it allowed me to learn the html, css, JavaScript. This whole Website was designed by myself and i feel it is very good for a first website. There were many difficultys i encountered in creating it but from every problem i encountered i learned from my mistakes and moved on. I received an A grade in college for this.
