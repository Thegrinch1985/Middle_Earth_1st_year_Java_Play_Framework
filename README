This was my 1st website in college. Originally built in notepad++ as a ststic website. After learning the Java Play Framework i decided to change the website in a Java Play Dynamic Website. This was a good experience and i learned a lot from it. To run the application download or clone the repository. Cd into the project folder and in terminal enter activator run. after all file are loaded you should be able to view the website on localhost:8000.
